# A simple "todo" application for devops traineeship

## Things that have been done

1. Developed a TODO list application using PHP language 
2. Deployed this application on a Linux VM with Nginx and PHP-FPM manually and then using Ansible for that.
3. Deployed the same application packaged to docker using docker compose
4. Deployed K8S cluster, google container registry, and service account for that using terraform.
5, Changed docker build in so the image would have the entire application vs mounted directories as it was in p3.
6. Deployed the application into K8S using raw manifests and MySQL form helm chart. 
7. Packaged the application into the helm and deploy to the same cluster.
